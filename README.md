# 🕵️‍♂️ Inquisitor

**Inquisitor** is an AI-powered tool that crawls and indexes website content, stores it in a vector database, and allows you to query that content using natural language. Perfect for building intelligent internal search systems or chatbot interfaces for your site.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jasmeen1347/inquisitor.git
cd inquisitor
```

### 2. Start the Vector Database with Docker

```bash
docker compose up
```

> This command will spin up any necessary services defined in `docker-compose.yml` (e.g., a vector database).

### 3. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Crawl and Store Website Data

```bash
python main.py
```

> This command will crawl data from the specified URL and store the processed information in the vector database.

### 5. Query the Data

```bash
python user.py
```

> Use this to ask questions. The system will respond based on the context stored in the vector database.

## 🤖 How It Works

1. **Crawling:** Extracts content from the provided site.
2. **Vectorization:** Converts text into embeddings and stores them in a vector database.
3. **Querying:** Uses semantic search to find and return the most relevant information.
